Ans. The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world.

- These computing devices were primarily traditional desktop PCs, Linux workstations, and so-called servers that store and transmit information such as Web pages and e-mail messages. 
 Increasingly, however, nontraditional Internet end systems such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, Web cams, automobiles, environmental sensing devices, picture frames, and home electrical and security systems are being connected to the Internet.    
 
- In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called hosts or end systems.    
 
- End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.   
 
- When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as packets.   
 
- A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in todayâ€™s Internet are routers and link-layer switches.     
 
- End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs). 
 
- End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).
